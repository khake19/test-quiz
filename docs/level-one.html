    <p>Welcome, you must be <em>the new one</em>, you know the chief technology officer? Well, she loves to have cool working applications but all our devs are busy right now and we have a bare-bones project that need some tweaks, would you mind to throw us a hand? Thanks, this is what we need.</p>
    <h3 id="client">/client</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Open <code>client/src/App.jsx</code> and give it a read, you will find what to do over there.</li>
      <li>Also we need to style the <code>Quiz view</code>, this is the mockup, please donâ€™t care about other pages or sections striked with red, we just need this one styled.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>As you read in the client we need to provide a question catalog and allow to <code>create, read, update and delete</code> via API.</li>
      <li>We work using test-driven development so we have already set up the tests for you. Please run the test suite using <code>bundle exec rspec --tag level=one</code> and do your best to cover all the specs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you finish, please remember to <code>commit &amp;&amp; push</code> to your branch.</p>
