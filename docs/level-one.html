      Welcome! You must be the new one! You know the <em>Chief Technology Officer</em>?
      Well, he loves creating cool working applications! Actually, we have a bare-bones
      project that needs some tweaks but all of our devs are busy right now.
      Would you mind throwing us a hand? Thanks!
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Implement a way for the user to create, read, update, and delete questions</li>
      <li>
        Implement a quiz view for the user to view and answer the questions one
        at a time and in <strong>random</strong> order
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the user provides an answer and clicks submits, the app should give
        immediate feedback on whether the answer provided is <strong>correct</strong>
        or <strong>incorrect</strong>
