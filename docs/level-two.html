    <p>
      Thanks for the help on the previous specs! If you’re still up for it,
      our product manager just passed by and asked us to add more features to the site.
      Would you mind taking care of it as well? You rock!
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember the question catalog you implemented? Well, now we would like to
      use it as a question bank to create quizzes. For that, we need to give the
      user the ability to list, <code>create, read, update, and delete</code> quizzes.
      To clarify, a quiz is composed of one or more questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another thing is that we would like to user to be able to select a quiz
      from a list and answer the questions in it in random order.
    </p>
    <p>I think that’s all! Let us know when it's done! Thanks!</p>
