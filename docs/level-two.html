    <p>Thanks for the help before, Hugo our product manager just pass by and give us some new specifications we would like to add to the site, would you mind to take care of it? You rock!</p>
    <p>Remember that previously we create a question catalog, well, now we would like to use it as a question bank to create Quizzes. So we need to give the site the ability to <code>list, create, read, update and delete</code> Quizzes and add questions to them.</p>
    <p>Also, we would like the user to be able to select a Quiz from a list and answer a random Question belonging to that Quiz, you might use the Question View that you already created.</p>
    <p>I think thatâ€™s all, let me know when you have it. Thanks.</p>
