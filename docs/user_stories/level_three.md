## 3: A minimum viable product

Hang in there! Actually, we would like to present this app to the _Chief Technology Officer_, but perhaps we can add a cool reporting feature.

When a user finishes a quiz, letâ€™s score it and compare it agains all the other registered attempts.

### Objective

*   After finishing a quiz, the user needs to be redirected to a results view. This view will be showing the score of the current try of the quiz and a comparison of it against the average of all other attempts made.
*   You will need to implement all of the backend logic for quiz attempt.

!> Once you finish, please remember to `commit && push` to your branch.

!> Run the test suite using `bundle exec rspec --tag level_three` and do your best to cover all the specs.
