## FAQ
### _Can I search the internet for help?_
Yes! Just be wary of copy and pasting code you don't understand because we will ask you.

### _Can I install third-party packages to help me?_
Yes again! But if you have time (and want the extra challenge), see if you can do it yourself! Just make sure to prioritize finishing everything first.
